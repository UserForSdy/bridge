			| The San Francisco Bridge Platform aims to provide the homeless shelters & service providers 
			| who assist our neighbors in need a way to communicate the inventory of their services in <strong>realtime</strong>.<br><br>
			| We believe access to <a href='http://bridge.braitsch.io/live'>realtime inventory data</a> will greatly improve the process of connecting people 
			| with the services they need while also helping providers cooperate together better than ever before.<br><br>
			| Bridge was conceived during the <a href='http://creative-currency.org/'>Creative Currency</a> festival this past spring and will be launching as a pilot program in San Francisco this fall.<br><br>
			| If you are interested in learning more or would like to pilot Bridge in your city â€“<br><br><a href="mailto:hello@bridge.tl?subject=San Francisco Bridge Project">Please get in touch!</a>
