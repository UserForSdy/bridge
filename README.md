##[San Francisco Bridge](http://bridge.braitsch.io/)

####A platform for recording and sharing the inventory of homeless shelters and related services in real-time.

This is a personal project that was spawned at the [Creative Currency](http://creative-currency.org/projects/bridge/) hackathon that took place in San Francisco in April 2012.

The goal of the project was to provide the city of San Francisco and the many service providers that assist our neighbors in the Mid-Market / Tenderloin area a way to easily communicate the inventory of their services in realtime.

Our long-term vision was to also allow our neighbors in need a convenient way to reserve these services via an SMS messaging system and a suite of touchscreen kiosks that would be installed throughout the city.
